Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.

This is so-called the entry point of a Flask web server. As you can see we are importing the Flask module and instantiating with the current file name in “Flask (__name__)”.
